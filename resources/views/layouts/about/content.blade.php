                 Among other things, the Sisters who founded this College have a sole aim of instilling genuine discipline and moral uprightness into our educational system in particular
                  and into the polity in general, with a view to turning out leaders who will sanitise our pluralistic Nigeria society and the world at large.
                  Effort is in top gear vigorously to achieve its desired success.

                  <p>
                  The foundation of the school was laid by the Catholic Bishop of Ilorin, His Lordship, Most Rev Dr. Ayo-Maria Atoyebi (OP) on 17th May 1999 and the take-off was on 27th september 1999 with eleven students.
                  To the greater glory of God, the track performance record of the college at WAEC and NECO has been 100% since inception.
